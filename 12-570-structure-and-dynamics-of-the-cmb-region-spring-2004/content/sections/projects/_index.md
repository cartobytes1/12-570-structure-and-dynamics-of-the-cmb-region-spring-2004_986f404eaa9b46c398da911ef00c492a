Final Reports
-------------

Term paper: NSF-type proposal focused on outstanding CMB question ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/projects/questions)), including a detailed research plan; 3-5 students per team; 15 pages maximum (including text + figures, but excluding references).

Topics chosen for the Spring 2004 final reports were:

*   LPO vs. SPO: a targeted D" anisotropy study beneath India
*   Searching geochemical evidences for the core contribution in mantle plume: Highly siderophile elements (HSE) partitioning in the liquid metal-silicate system at core-mantle boundary condition
*   MgSiO3 phase change near CMB: Experiments and Implications
*   Seismic imaging and modeling of the core-mantle boundary beneath the southern Indian Ocean
